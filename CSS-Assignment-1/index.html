    <h3><i>What is CSS?</i></h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet</li>
            <br>
            <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media</li>
            <br>
            <li><b class="not">Css is not neccesary </b><b>CSS saves a lot of work.</b> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
            <br>
            <li><i class="underline">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</i></li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h3><i>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</i></h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
            <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
            <li>External - by using the a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
            <li>The most common way to add CSS, is keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <b>in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</b> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try if yourself.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        When comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference id that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID,on the hand,applies a style to one unique element. ID is also
        special in that you can use a special URl to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
        In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted,a style or set of styles can applied to the element 
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a wide range of selector available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target element to which a style should be applied.
